# oasys_hercules (15,17 March 2022)
Material for three-hours tutorial "Modelling Synchrotron Radiation Beamlines with OASYS" at the HERCULES school

## Download and install Oasys:
Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/oasys-kit/oasys-installation-scripts/wiki

## Contents

- A) Introduction to Oasys
- B) Transport of power in a beamline: source emission and power absorbed/emitted by the elements
- C) Transport of photons using ray tracing: intensity and beam shape at the sample
- D) Introduction to transport of beam coherence: evolution of coherent fraction and wave optics propagation

## Workspaces

There are four workspaces for the course. You can download this complete github repo (https://github.com/oasys-esrf-kit/oasys_hercules/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or (easier) from Oasys use the option "Load Remote" and enter the URL of the workspaces:

## Following the course

The course can be followed using OASYS installed locally in your own laptop or, alternatively, via the http://pan-learning.org/ platform (no installation is required, but login as user is needed).
