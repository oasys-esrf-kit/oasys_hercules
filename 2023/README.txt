Material for HERCULES 2023 tutorial on OASYS:

Modelling synchrotron radiation beamlines with Oasys
====================================================

We will address the basic concepts in beam transport in synchrotron 
beamlines.

Contents
--------
A) Introduction to Oasys (30 min by Juan Reyes-Herrera)
B) Transport of power in a beamline: source emission and power 
  absorbed/emitted by the elements (60 min by Juan Reyes-Herrera)
C) Transport of photons using ray tracing: intensity and beam shape at 
  the sample (60 min by Manuel Sanchez del Rio)
D) Introduction to transport of beam coherence: evolution of coherent 
  fraction and wave optics propagation (30 min by Manuel Sanchez del Rio)
